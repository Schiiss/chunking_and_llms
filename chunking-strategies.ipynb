    "\n",
    "1. What is the nature of the content being indexed? Are you working with long documents, such as articles or books, or shorter content, like tweets or instant messages? The answer would dictate both which model would be more suitable for your goal and, consequently, what chunking strategy to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are your expectations for the length and complexity of user queries? Will they be short and specific or long and complex? This may inform the way you choose to chunk your content as well so that there‚Äôs a closer correlation between the embedded query and embedded chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How will the retrieved results be utilized within your specific application? For example, will they be used for semantic search, question answering, summarization, or other purposes?"
